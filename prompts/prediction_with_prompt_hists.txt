This is a sociology 101 mid-term exam.

Predict response from the user to the news headline in terms of exact comment words (i.e., what would user reply in comment), sentiment polarity (i.e., Positive, Neutral, Negative), and sentiment intensity (integer scaled between 0-3 inclusively where 0 means no intensity and 3 means the most intense). Note: when sentiment polarity is neutral, the sentiment intensity should be 0.

In other words, filling the <answer> in the categories below. Separate by newline:
Comment: <answer>
Sentiment Polarity: <answer>
Sentiment Intensity: <answer>

I will iteratively provide the news headline, user profile, user history, and user structurized profile (inferred by AI). Here is the information,

[news headline]: '{post}'.

[user profile]: '{profile}'.

[user historical posts]: '{history}'.

[user structurized profile]: '{key}'.
